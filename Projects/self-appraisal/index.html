                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p> Customers who lease or buy vehicles face a challenging appraisal process when trying to assess vehicle condition before ending a lease or trading in their car. For dealerships and leasing companies, accurately evaluating vehicle conditions remotely is time-consuming, often requiring follow-up inspections and leading to unexpected costs, disputes, and missed opportunities for smoother sales and customer satisfaction.</p> 
            </div>

                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                
                Dealerships, leasing companies, and OEMs need a streamlined, reliable way to assess vehicle conditions from a distance. Customers need a simple, trustworthy tool that lets them document vehicle condition accurately and transparently, reducing surprises and easing decisions for everyone involved.

        <div class="image-grid">
            <div class="columnflex">
               <p> Early in the project, I conducted a thorough competitive analysis of existing vehicle appraisal solutions. This research revealed several opportunities for innovation, particularly around user guidance and photo capture assistance. While competitors offered basic documentation tools, none provided the seamless, guided experience our users needed.</p>
               <img src="../../static/images/self-appraisal/competition.png" alt="Competitive analysis of existing solutions" style="width:80%;">
                <p>
                    Working closely with our product managers and sales team, I gathered insights about user pain points and business requirements. These collaborative sessions helped identify key opportunities:
<br>
            - Product managers shared user feedback from existing tools<br>
            - Sales team provided insights about dealer priorities and workflows<br>
            - Development team helped identify technical constraints and possibilities

                <p> Through surveys and interviews with customers, we uncovered the motivations of our key stakeholders, and to further empathise with their experiences, I developed detailed user personas. These personas served as a foundation for all subsequent design decisions, ensuring the solution was tailored to their unique needs.</p>

                <p>
                    Using the personas, I crafted realistic user scenarios to understand how they would interact with the app. These were used as hypotheses about user behaviour, which were validated during early usability tests.

            <p>Together with the PMs, we mapped detailed user journeys to visualise the end-to-end experience for our primary personas. These journeys helped identify friction points, such as unclear instructions for photo capture, which informed the development of features like guided photo capture and progress tracking.

            <img src="../../static/images/self-appraisal/userjourney.png" alt="User Journey Map" style="width:70%;">
            <p> I mapped out a comprehensive user flow encompassing key interactions. The flow addressed critical steps in the self-appraisal process, from initiating the appraisal to receiving and reviewing results, with clear decision points and feedback loops.

        <p>To generate innovative solutions, I facilitated workshops with cross-functional teams and collaborated regularly with:
            <br>
            - Developers for technical feasibility<br>
            - Product managers for business alignment<br>
            - Sales team for market feedback<br>
            - Quality assurance for testing considerations</p>
            <p>Starting with low-fidelity wireframes, I refined flows and screens through multiple feedback cycles.</p>
         <img src="../../static/images/self-appraisal/wireframes.png" alt="Low-Fidelity wireframes"  style="width:60%;">
         <p>These iterations culminated in a hi-fidelity interactive prototype that captured the full user journey. To ensure consistency and scalability, I designed a comprehensive design system in Figma, which served as the foundation for all UI components and interactions.</p>
         <img src="../../static/images/self-appraisal/designsystem2.png" alt="hi-fidelity interactive prototype from Figma File"  >
         <p> 
            Our key advantage is a streamlined, user-centric appraisal journey. Instead of making users circle the vehicle multiple times, we integrate beauty and damage shots into a single flow. After capturing a beauty shot, users immediately document any damage in that area, reducing movement, saving time, and ensuring no damage is missed.</p>
         <img src="../../static/images/self-appraisal/hifimockups.png" alt="hi-fidelity interactive prototype from Figma File"  style="width:60%;">
         <p>A key feature of the design system is its customisable colour scheme. The app's primary and secondary colours can be updated to reflect each dealership's unique brand identity, ensuring alignment with their visual standards and providing a personalised user experience. Dealers can further personalise the interface by adding their logo, allowing the app to integrate seamlessly with their existing sales tools.</p>

             <p>To ensure the final product meet user and business needs effectively, I conducted a moderated usability test using Userlytics. The goal of the usability test was to evaluate the app's interface and user experience, focusing on task completion, clarity of language, ease of navigation, and the effectiveness of calls-to-action. It aims to identify areas for improvement to ensure users can navigate the app intuitively and achieve their goals smoothly.</p>

             <p>Usability testing confirmed the vehicle self-appraisal tool’s success, with high satisfaction ratings (4-5/5). Users found the step-by-step guidance and photo alignment features particularly helpful. Testing revealed three improvement areas: interior photo challenges, unclear post-submission steps, and initial confusion in damage reporting. </p>
