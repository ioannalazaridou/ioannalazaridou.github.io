By reviewing their project images, I understood their preference for minimalistic designs blending modern and traditional elements, emphasizing quality. Using this insight, I created wireframes to present initial concepts. Upon approval, I refined them into mid-fidelity mockups, collaborating closely with the client to capture the desired aesthetic accurately. With approved mockups, I developed a minimalistic color palette and typography guide in line with the studio's identity. We agreed on text styles and imagery. To ensure client satisfaction, high-fidelity mockups were created using Figma. This meticulous process guarantees the website design reflects the studio's aesthetics and meets the client's vision before entering the development phase.</p>
