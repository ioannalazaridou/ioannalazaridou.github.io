        <h2>Background Research</h2>
        <p>Despite the UN SDG target of reducing maternal mortality rates, the global rate of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births is over three-fold greater than the target. Complications during pregnancy are a major cause of death in children under five, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Many of these deaths can be prevented or treated if proper healthcare is available early on. Therefore, it is crucial to improve access to and utilization of good-quality prenatal care to lower maternal and infant mortality rates in developing areas.</p>

            <p>We conducted research to gain insights into pregnancy tools and users. Based on our understanding of the problem landscape, we conducted a mixed-methods survey. The survey involved 83 participants primarily from the UK, South Africa, US, Greece, and Japan. Most participants were married/in a relationship, aged 20-39, and had previous childbirth experience.</p>

            <h3>Quantitative Insights</h3>
            <p>1) Primary information sources were friends/family, medical providers, and search engines.<br><br>
                2) Medical providers were most trusted, but friends/family were rated highest for enjoyment/relatability.<br><br>
                3) Friends/family offer accessible, supportive, and relatable information, while medical professionals are seen as inaccessible and medicalized.<br><br>
                4) Majority relied on parents and friends for social support.</p>
                <h3>Qualitative Insights</h3>

        <p>Yemaya effectively addresses user pain points, providing an innovative digital solution for pregnant women to improve their experience and reduce complications. The health education component supports autonomy and aligns with UN SDG 5 and SDG 3. Integration with messaging apps ensures accessibility and privacy. The project advances HCI and allowed me to enhance my user research and visual design skills as the sole UI designer, progressing from low-fidelity to high-fidelity mockups.

Our participants, were not currently pregnant, potentially affecting the validity of our findings. Limited project scope prevented the implementation of all desired features, and the prototype needs additional high-fidelity testing. Further refining the user flow and exploring additional functionality can enhance the user experience.</p>
